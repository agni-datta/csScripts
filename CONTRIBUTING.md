## Contributing to Computer Science Scripts (csScripts)

We extend our sincere appreciation for your interest in contributing to the csScripts project. This document delineates the guidelines and protocols for contributing to this scholarly endeavor.

### Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to maintain a high standard of professional conduct. We are committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and collaborative academic environment.

### Contribution Methodology

#### Reporting Software Defects

When identifying a defect in the software, please initiate an issue on the GitHub repository with the following comprehensive information:

- A precise and descriptive title
- A detailed exposition of the defect, including its technical characteristics
- Methodical steps to reproduce the defect
- Expected computational behavior
- Observed computational behavior
- Visual documentation or code excerpts (where applicable)
- Environmental specifications (operating system, Python version, etc.)

#### Proposing Enhancements

When proposing an enhancement to the software, please initiate an issue on the GitHub repository with the following comprehensive information:

- A precise and descriptive title
- A detailed exposition of the proposed enhancement
- Relevant exemplars or use cases demonstrating utility
- Potential implementation strategies and architectural considerations

#### Pull Request Protocol

1. Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account
2. Establish a new branch for your feature implementation or defect resolution
3. Implement your modifications with adherence to coding standards
4. Execute the test suite to ensure preservation of existing functionality
5. Submit a formal pull request for review and integration

### Development Environment Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment
2. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. Execute the test suite:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Perform code quality analysis:

   ```bash
   flake8 scripts tests
   ```

5. Conduct static type checking:

   ```bash
   mypy scripts tests
   ```

### Coding Standards and Conventions

#### Python Style Guidelines

- Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Utilize 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Employ descriptive and semantically meaningful variable and function nomenclature
- Maintain line length under 88 characters for optimal readability
- Implement type hints for function parameters and return values to enhance type safety

#### Documentation Standards

- Implement [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for all code elements
- Include comprehensive parameter descriptions, return value specifications, and illustrative examples
- Document complex algorithms with appropriate mathematical notation and references

#### Testing Methodology

- Develop comprehensive tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass successfully before submitting a pull request
- Strive for high test coverage to ensure software reliability
- Implement both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
