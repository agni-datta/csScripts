# Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the csScripts project. You can add detailed guides, API documentation, and usage instructions for each script or module here.

## Structure

- Add a separate markdown file for each major script or feature.
- Use clear section headings and code examples.
- Link to relevant files in the `scripts/` and `examples/` folders.

## Getting Started

- See the main [README.md](../README.md) for an overview of the project.
- For usage examples, see the [examples](../examples/) folder.

## Extending Documentation

- To document a new script, create a file like `scriptname.md` in this folder.
- Use code blocks and explanations to help users understand how to use each script.
